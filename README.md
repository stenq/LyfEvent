Event Search and Discovery Users can search for upcoming events in their area or based on interests (e.g., concerts, sports, festivals, meetups). Filters by date, location, event type, etc.
Room Creation and Invitations Users can create private or public "rooms" to invite others to attend an event together. Option to invite friends or open the invitation to others who are attending the same event.
Group Messenger Each room would have a group chat where users can discuss event plans, meeting points, etc. Can include features like polls for group decisions (e.g., where to meet before the event, etc.).
User Profiles Users can create profiles that show their interests, past events attended, and upcoming events. Profiles can have friend requests and followers, depending on the type of community you're building.
People Nearby Feature Users can search for or discover other users who are attending the same event or are nearby. Possibly add an option to view users with similar event interests or location-based connections.
